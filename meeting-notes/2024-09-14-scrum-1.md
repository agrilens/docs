#Sprint Planning:
_Backlog refinement_**

-What was the Sprint goal?
We plan on doing research on what others have done. After research, we will choose language, model, framework, training methods to LVM, and collectively put those together for a rough outline in Figma. 

-*As the product owner:* What feature will add the most value for this sprint?
The most valuable take-away from this sprint is to have a proposal for how the project should look and operate. 

-What do we plan to do to achieve this sprint goal? 
The end goal is to have enough data to understand which frameworks to move forward with. 

-How difficult will each task be? 
Decided that each task will have the same levels of difficulties because lots of research is involved. 

-How will we collaborate? 
We will collaborate through communication and fulfilling backlog tickets on ZenHub.
