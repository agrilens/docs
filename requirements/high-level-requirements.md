# High-Level Requirements

## Functional Requirements
1. Image Capture: Allow users to take photos of plant leaves or upload existing images
2. Disease Identification: Analyze images to identify potential diseases or health issues
3. Basic Recommendations: Provide simple care instructions based on identified issues
4. Location Data Collection: Capture and store GPS coordinates for each plant health analysis
5. Data Visualization: Generate heatmaps and other visualizations of plant health issues across geographical areas
6. Localization: Support multiple languages and regional settings
7. Data Aggregation: Collect and store anonymized user data, including disease identifications, locations, and timestamps
