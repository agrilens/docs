# Project Documentation Structure

## Overview
This document outlines the structure and location of our project documentation, including requirements, processes, and decision-making strategies.

## Documentation Locations

1. GitHub Repository
   - Main location for all code-related documentation
   - Structure:
     ```
     /docs
     ├── requirements/
     │   ├── high-level-requirements.md
     │   ├── user-stories.md
     │   └── feature-specific/
     │       ├── feature1-requirements.md
     │       └── feature2-requirements.md
     ├── processes/
     │   ├── requirement-gathering.md
     │   ├── decision-making.md
     │   └── team-onboarding.md
     ├── architecture/
     │   ├── system-overview.md
     │   └── component-diagrams/
     ├── meeting-notes/
     │   └── (dated meeting notes)
     └── README.md (overview of doc structure)
     ```

2. Project Wiki (GitHub Wiki or similar)
   - For more dynamic, frequently updated content
   - Sections:
     - Project Overview
     - Team Members and Roles
     - Development Workflow
     - FAQ
     - Glossary of Terms

3. Issue Tracker (GitHub Issues)
   - Link issues to relevant documentation
   - Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., 'requirement', 'bug', 'enhancement')

4. Artifacts
   - Store in `/docs/artifacts/` within the repo
   - Name format: `YYYY-MM-DD_artifact-name.md`
   - Include context and decisions made

## Maintenance

- Schedule bi-weekly documentation review meetings
- Assign a documentation owner to oversee updates
- Use pull requests for significant documentation changes

## New Team Member Onboarding

1. Start with `README.md` in the root of the repository
2. Review the Project Wiki for high-level understanding
3. Explore `/docs` folder for detailed information
4. Schedule a walkthrough with an existing team member

## Grading Considerations

- Ensure all major decisions are documented in `/docs/decisions/`
- Keep a running log of contributions in `/docs/contributions.md`
- Maintain up-to-date project status in `/docs/project-status.md`

## Tools and Access

- GitHub: Main repository for code and documentation
- [Additional tools, if any, e.g., Jira, Confluence]

Remember to update this structure as the project evolves. Regular reviews will ensure our documentation remains relevant and useful.
