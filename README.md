# Agrilens: Plant Health Identification Service

Agrilens is a scrum-based project developing a service to 
  - Identify plant health for resource-constrained farmers
  - Aggregate and analyze plant health data
  - Provide insights based on data collected to help save labor and resources

## Quick Start

[Team: Instructions for setting up and running the project locally once we have code]
[Users: Instructions for using the service]

## Project Overview

Our service aims to help farmers with limited resources by:
- Identifying plant health issues including diseases & pests
- Providing basic analytics to optimize resource use and show problems areas of the farm
- Offering insights and information without requiring extensive technical knowledge from end users

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized to serve four primary user groups: Current Team Members, Instructor, Customers/Stakeholders, and New Team Members.

Key locations:
- `/docs`: Main documentation directory
  - `/requirements/`: Project requirements and specifications
  - `/design/`: System design documents and diagrams
  - `/user-guides/`: End-user documentation and guides
  - `/processes/`: Team procedures and decision-making strategies
  - `/meeting-notes/`: Meeting notes and decision logs
  - `/artifacts/`: Project artifacts and outputs that do not fit into the other categories

For full documentation structure and guidelines, see [`/docs/structure.md`](/structure.md).

## Project Status

- Currently we are gathering requirements, researching existing solutions, and prototyping key parts of the product

## Next Steps
Our immediate priorities are:

- [] Continue gathering and refining requirements from stakeholders
- [] Research and evaluate potential technologies and existing solutions
- [] Begin synthesizing findings to inform our product & design choices

These steps will guide our development process and help us make decisions about our service's architecture and features.
