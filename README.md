# Agrilens: Plant Health Identification Service
Agrilens is a scrum-based project developing a service to 
  - Identify plant health for resource-constrained farmers
  - Aggregate and analyze plant health data
  - Provide insights based on data collected to help save labor and resources

## Project Status

- The latest build of the project is deployed at [Agrilens-web](https://agrilens-web.web.app/).
- We are iterating on the application's design and incorporating end user and stakeholder feedback.
- For questions or suggestions about the project or documentation, please contact Jessica or Blair.

## Works Cited & Sources

- We used generative AI in this project. Artifacts and other documents where we used generative AI contain a note about the source and a link to the conversation. 

## Project Overview
Our service aims to help farmers with limited resources by:
- Identifying plant health issues including diseases & pests
- Providing basic analytics to optimize resource use and show problems areas of the farm
- Offering insights and information without requiring extensive technical knowledge from end users

## Deployment

- Located at [`/docs/deployment-guide.md`](/deployment-guide.md)
- Comprehensive instructions for deploying AgriLens
- Includes system requirements, installation steps, and configuration details

## Development

- Located at [`/docs/developer-guide.md`](/developer-guide.md)
- Contains setup instructions for development environment
- Outlines coding standards and contribution process
- Provides overview of project architecture

## Documentation Structure

- Our documentation is organized to serve four primary groups: Current Team Members, Instructor, System Administrators, Software Contributors & Maintainers, and New Team Members. 
- We will reorganize this as the project grows to serve each group more effectively. 

Key locations:
- `/docs`: Main documentation directory
  - `/requirements/`: Project requirements and specifications
  - `/design/`: System design documents and diagrams
  - `/user-guides/`: End-user documentation and guides
  - `/processes/`: Team procedures and decision-making strategies
  - `/meeting-notes/`: Meeting notes and decision logs
  - `/artifacts/`: Project artifacts and outputs that do not fit into the other categories

For full documentation structure and guidelines, see [`/docs/documentation-structure.md`](/documentation-structure.md).
