# AgriLens Deployment Guide

> **Current as of: November 2024**  
> This guide covers deploying AgriLens using GitHub and Firebase.

## 1. Introduction
AgriLens is a React-based web application for plant health identification. This guide covers deployment using Git and Firebase, providing a streamlined development and deployment workflow. This guide is written for system administrators and assumes working knowledge of Git, Firebase, API keys, and environment variables. 

## 2. Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Firebase account with Blaze Plan
- Web browser
- Local development environment (such as VS Code)
- Node.js 18

## 3. Initial Setup

### 3.1 Fork the agriLens-backend Repository
1. Visit the [agrilens-backend repository on GitHub](https://github.com/agrilens/agrilens-backend)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination
4. Select the ```main``` branch to fork
5. Clone the forked repo to your local machine using your IDE.

### 3.2 Fork the agriLens-frontend Repository
1. Visit the [agrilens-frontend repository on GitHub](https://github.com/agrilens/agrilens-frontend)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination
4. Select the ```main``` branch to fork
5. Clone the forked repo to your local machine using your IDE.

### 3.3 Obtain Hyperbolic & PlantID API Keys
1. Visit [PlantID](https://www.kindwise.com/plant-id) to obtain an API key.
2. Visit [Hyperbolic Labs](https://hyperbolic.xyz/) to obtain an API key.

### 3.4 Firebase Backend Setup
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project named "agrilens-web". If that name is unavailable, you will need to update "agrilens-web" with the new name in ```.firebasrc``` in both the agrilens-frontend and agrilens-backend repos.
3. Go to Project Overview > Project Settings in the upper left corner of the Firebase console. Click on the "Service Accounts" tab. Then click "Generate a New Private Key." This will cause a JSON file to be saved to your machine. You will use these values to fill in the backend .env in a later step.

### 3.5 Firebase Frontend Setup
1. Again, go to Project Overview > Project Settings. Click on the "General" tab. Then under "Your Apps," click the "</>" symbol to register your app.
2. Register your app using the same name as the project from 3.4.2 for convenience. 
3. Under Project Overview > Project Settings > General > Your App > "SDK setup and configuration", select "Config" and copy the values. You will use these values to fill in the frontend .env in a later step.

### 3.6 Firebase Services
1. For the following steps 2-6, on the left side of the Firebase homepage, click "Build" to access Authentication, Firestore Database, Functions, and Hosting tabs. 
2. Click "Authentication." Then "Get Started." Then under "Native Providers," click "Email/Password," and finally toggle the enable setting.
3. Click "Firestore Database." Then "Create Database" with the default settings in Production Mode. Start a collection called "users". Then add a document called "customers". Then start a collection under "customers" called "customer" with the Auto-ID feature and click "Save". See screenshots below: 
![data-model-1](./artifacts/database-data-model-1.png)
![data-model-2](./artifacts/database-data-model-2.png)

4. Click "Functions". Then "Get Started". You will need to upgrade to the Blaze plan if you have not done so already, but do not run the provided commands at this time. 
5. Click "Hosting". Then "Get Started," and follow the prompts with the default settings, but do not run the provided commands at this time.
6. Click "Storage". Then "Get Started", and follow the prompts to "Set up default bucket" in Production Mode.

### 3.7 Firebase Services
1. After completing 3.6, your Firebase Services panel should look like this:
![firebase-services-panel](./artifacts/firebase-services-panel.png)

## 4. Backend Environment Configuration

### 4.1 Set Up Environment Variables
1. In your IDE, create a new `.env` file in the /functions directory of the agrilens-backend repo:
```bash
   cd functions
   cp .env.example .env
```

2. Add required environment variables from the JSON file that was downloaded when you created a new private key, as well as your Hyperbolic and PlantID API keys:
```plaintext
   HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY="yourhyperbolicapikey"
   PLANT_ID_API_KEY="yourplantidapikey"
   
   TYPE_VALUE="service_account"
   PROJECT_ID_VALUE="yourprojectname"
   PROJECT_BUCKET_NAME="yourprojectname.firebasestorage.app"
   PRIVATE_KEY_ID_VALUE="this is private_key_id value in the json file"
   PRIVATE_KEY_VALUE="this begins with -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and ends with -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   CLIENT_EMAIL_VALUE="this is the client_email value in the json file"
   CLIENT_ID_VALUE="this is the client_id value in the json file"
   AUTH_URI_VALUE="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
   TOKEN_URI_VALUE="https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
   AUTH_PROVIDER_CERT_URL_VALUE="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
   CLIENT_CERT_URL_VALUE="this is the client_x509_cert_url value in the json file"
   UNIVERSE_DOMAIN_VALUE="googleapis.com"
```

## 5. Deploy Backend

### 5.1 Setup Backend & Login to Firebase
1. Run the following commands:
```bash
   npm install firebase
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
```
2. Follow the prompts to login to Firebase CLI
   
### 5.2 Build & Deploy Backend
```bash
cd functions
npm i
npm run serve
```
1. You may need to install ```serve``` with ```npm i serve```.
2. If ```npm run serve``` is successful, you may exit the Firebase emulator and then run:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

3. From the ```firebase deploy --only functions``` terminal output, copy and save the URL (yours will be different than the one in this guide). The line will begin with "Function URL (app(us-central1)):" and end with the URL. Copy the entire URL. You will need this URL in the next step.

## 6. Frontend Environment Configuration

### 6.1
1. In your IDE, create a new `.env` file in the root of the agrilens-frontend repo:
```bash
   cp .env.example .env
```
2. Get Firebase config values from step 2:
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Project Settings
   - Scroll to "Your apps"
   - Click web app icon (</>)
   - Register app and copy "Config". It will look like this:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAIbkahHG-I8Us8gSyzmRrobHqHcIC4rYI",
  authDomain: "agrilens-deploy.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "agrilens-deploy",
  storageBucket: "agrilens-deploy.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "918841086899",
  appId: "1:918841086899:web:15d168864c0451b8dff1c6"
};
```
     
3. Copy your config values into the .env:
```plaintext
## Variable names should start with `REACT_APP`
## Values do not need quotes
## Firebase configuration
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=apiKeyFromFireBaseConfig
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=appIdFromFirebaseConfig
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=messagingSenderIdFromFirebaseConfig
# REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=optionalGoogleMeasurementID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=authDomainFromFirebaseConfig
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=projectIdFromFirebaseConfig
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=storageBucketFromFirebaseConfig
## Backend api endpoints
## Dev - You may ignore this unless developing locally
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001/yourprojectname/your-region/app
## Prod
REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=urlFromDeploymentOfBackend
```

5. Using the URL from 5.2.3, copy the URL value into the .env:
```plaintext
REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=urlFromDeploymentOfBackend
```

### 7 Build & Deploy frontend

## 7.1 Build frontend
1. In the agrilens-frontend repo, start a terminal session and login to Firebase CLI if you are not logged in:
```bash
firebase login
```
2. Run the following commands:
```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

## 7.2 Deploy frontend
1. Deploy the frontend to Firebase by running these command:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
1.1 This will deploy the frontend from the ```./build``` directory by default, which is the same directory used by the previous command, ```npm run build```. If your ```npm``` installation uses different directories, you will need to make sure the build uses the ```./build``` directory, or else run ```firebase init``` and select Hosting, then follow the prompts and response with the following:
```bash
? What do you want to use as your public directory? build
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? No
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
```
2. If successful, you will see the following in the terminal output:
```bash
âœ”  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/agrilens-deploy/overview
Hosting URL: https://agrilens-deploy.web.app
```
