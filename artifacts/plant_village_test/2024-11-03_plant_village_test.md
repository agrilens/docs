# Plant Village Test README

### Test qwen2-vl-72b-instruct against Plant Village plant pest and disease dataset

- We tested this model against this dataset to validate that our main model has acceptable accuracy for this task, and also to serve as a benchmark in case the maintainers of this project would like to replace this model.
