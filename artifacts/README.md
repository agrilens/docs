# Project Artifacts

## Overview
This directory contains important documents and outputs (artifacts) from our project. These documents serve as a log of our decisionmaking, as a reference, and as a guide to help new team members get up to speed. As we're just starting, this structure is minimal and will grow with the project.

## Adding New Artifacts
- Place new documents in this directory
- Use descriptive names for files (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_system-design.md`, `YYYY-MM-DD_research-findings.md`)
- Update this README when adding significant new artifacts

## Usage
- Reference these artifacts in GitHub Issues and Pull Requests as needed
- Keep documents up to date as the project progresses
