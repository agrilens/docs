# Data Dashboard Prototype

Using Claude (conversation: https://claude.ai/chat/1ed9688c-306e-4971-a5d5-a4d95f94a381), the prototype react app in '/docs/artifacts/data-dashboard' allows the user to upload a photo, calls the Qwen API, and parses the response, collecting values to visualize. Getting the model to adhere to a consistent json output and return meaningful values (categorical "healthy"/"unhealthy" may be easier than numeric confidence scores) will take more work. 

However, this is meant to demo how the dashboard might look, so for now placeholder values are okay. 

See the screenshots in /docs/artifacts/data-dashboard for how the dashboard could look.
