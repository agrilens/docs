# Project Documentation Structure

## Overview
This document outlines our project documentation structure, designed to serve four primary user groups:
1. Current Team Members
2. Instructor
3. Customers and Stakeholders
4. New Team Members

## Key Documentation

1. GitHub Repo: argilens/docs
   - `README.md`: Documentation overview and navigation guide
   - `/requirements/`: Project requirements and specifications

   - `/user-guides/`: End-user documentation and guides
   - `/processes/`: Team procedures and decision-making strategies
   - `/meeting-notes/`: Meeting notes and decision logs
   - `/artifacts/`: Project artifacts and outputs that do not fit into the other categories

2. Issue Tracker: GitHub Issues & Zenhub
   - Linked to relevant documentation
   - Categorized with labels (e.g., 'requirement', 'bug')

## Maintenance
